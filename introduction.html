            <h1 id="how-to-use-this-site">How to use this site?</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>Use the <a href="./index.html">Index</a> to search for what you need.</li>
            <li>If I explicitly sent you a link to one of my pages/posts/notes, it was sent(or in some cases <em>published</em>) with the thought that it could be useful to you. See <a href="./link_sharing.html">link_sharing</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Please make sure that before reading anything on this site the last-updated date is close to current date, so that the information posted is relevant/reliable at the time of reading.</strong></li>
            <li>If I feel that any post does not need to be updated anymore (for posts which share anecdotal evidence or commenting on some event, random rants/ramblings etc.), I will <strong>freeze</strong> the post and its contents.</li>
            <li>Stay curious and try to read the posts on this page objectively. Analyze them critically. I may not find space in each and every article to start from the ‘scratch’. While writing I always assume that the reader(usually me) is curious enough to read between the lines.</li>
            <li>Referring to the list of pre-requisites at the start of an article would maximize the benefits of reading articles.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 id="how-can-you-help-me">How can you help me?</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>Please report any errors/misconceptions you find. I will update them after reviewing.</li>
            <li>Also check out <a href="./bounty.html">bounty</a> and see if you can help me out, in return for <em>monnneey</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>First Advice: <em>Start!!</em></li>
            <li>There will always be things to edit, more to add, errors to correct, but saying that <em>I will post it online when it is done perfectly will never make it happen.</em> The cost of perfection is infinite.</li>
            <li>Again the only advice I can give is <em>Start!!</em></li>

            <li><a href="https://ccpandhare.github.io/GSoC-Guide/">Chinmay Pandhare</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> and the open source community in general has helped me immensely in creating the functional form of this website.</li>
