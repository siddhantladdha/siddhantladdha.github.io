            <h3 id="elementary-os">Elementary OS</h3>
            <p>Elementary OS will make you audibly orgasm to it’s simple, elegant and consistent design. The Human Interface guidelines put in place by the creator of the distribution is one of it’s kind and is strictly followed by those who develop programs for the distribution. As far as aesthetics and user friendliness is concerned nothing beats elementary OS in the Linux World. That being said, I choose to call Elementary as <strong>a Nightmare dressed like a daydream.</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. It is awesome, if you never tinker and leave your OS as is, however, once you try to tinker, it will be a restrictive experience. In addition to that, stable release distributions never appealed to me as a non-server user. Not getting the most updated versions of my favourite programs is a massive turn off for me.</p>
            <p>However, if you are a beginner or installing Linux on your parent’s laptop, Elementary is the way to go! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw">The Linux Experiment</a> makes quite good videos about Elementary OS and it’s app ecosystem.</p>
            <h3 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux</h3>
            <p>If you are a power user/want to learn a lot about GNU+Linux take a look at Arch Linux. You Distro will anyway guide you to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Wiki</a> in many cases. You won’t be disappointed that’s for sure. I use Arch Linux as my daily driver with KDE Desktop environment. A few points for newbies.</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><p>There is one and only one <em>useful</em> installation guide in existence for Arch Linux which is aptly served by <a href="https://www.wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide">Installation Guide</a></p></li>
            <li><p>Why are you installing Arch Linux? This to have a clear idea of what you need and what you don’t. If you keep on installing all the packages listed on the ArchWiki then you will completely lose the essence of customisation Arch Linux has to offer. For instance, my reason for installing Arch Linux is it’s high customisability and rolling release nature which allows me to have full control over what software is installed and allows me to use new features as soon as they leave testing repositories and not wait for 6 months until official software repositories are updated.</p></li>
            <li><p>Maintaining your installation: If you think that Arch Linux is like build once and forget, then you might not be wrong!! If something doesn’t work after/during, upgrades refer the Arch Mailing list. Usually some bugs rarely escape the testing repository and some of these package updates require manual intervention. In the <em>linux pop culture</em> many people make jokes about this issue with Arch. However, this doesn’t happen too often for me around once every 6 months or so and that to when I was not subscribed to the mailing list.</p></li>
