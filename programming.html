            <li>Programming and Computer Science are different even though the keywords are clubbed. You will find resources for Computer science here as well.</li>
            <li>The heading can be argued about, but meh. People anyways read what piques their interest.</li>

            <li>Elaborating this since I might be the wrong person for some types of advice.</li>
            <li>I did not study computer science beyond Network Level C Programming. I might not be the right person for taking advice regarding Computer Science.</li>
            <li>I did not write any production level software for Computers, hence I might not be the right person for taking advice regarding software development.</li>
            <li>I usually yank scripts from internet and seldom write scripts to get some boring work done.</li>

            <li>The language kills more than the snake.</li>

            <li>My only problem with Python is that <strong>It allows me to write poor quality code/program with very less effort</strong>. Also, after about month I realized that I write poor quality code in C (it just takes 1 week instead of 15 mins). So I might be broken.</li>
            <li>People shit on other people for using Python, but here’s the thing, great programmers write great programs in any language. Python might be a bottleneck to your program performance/benchmarks, but if it gets your work done ignore others.</li>
            <li>Also, I am a hypocrite when it comes to python. I never took real efforts in understanding the language. I try reading Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart cover to cover but all efforts go in vain.</li>
            <li>Currently I use Python only when required from the above reference.</li>
            <li><strong>P</strong>ython is <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>O</strong>riented <strong>P</strong>oop (POOP) is an acronym that comes to mind, but I am in no position to say so.</li>

            <h2 id="perl">Perl</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>I came 1 nm close to learning perl. I have seen/heard lots of awesome things about it, loved the community but here’s the thing. Python was a default sane choice. I know I am following the herd mentality here, but programming is not my bread and butter so spending any more time analysing about my choices will not be judicious use of my time. If I <em>need</em> to learn perl, you will see the resources here.</li>
