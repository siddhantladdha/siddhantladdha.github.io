# What is this page about?

- There are some tasks that I want done, however I might not have either the skill and/or time, resources, interest
et cetera to complete the task. In that case I believe the best way to complete it is to outsource it to somebody
who has the above required qualities, to successfully complete the task.
- Payment will be made via Paypal(~~Bitcoin~~).
- The cost of each bounty is referenced from Fiverr and experience. If it is low, tell me why I should bump it up.
- If a bounty is listed as *community* that means the aim is to form a community around it. This word is reserved for heavy duty projects, for which a single person does not have the bandwidth and money to pursue. Contact Me if interested.
- If you are a freelancer, I am willing to give a testimonial on your website as an additional thank you!!
- When communicating with me regarding the bounties use the subject format specified below
- **Do Not** initiate contact for changing the licensing of solution. The licensing of solution is subject to change without any notice.
