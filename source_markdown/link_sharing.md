- If I explicitly sent you a link to one of my pages/posts/notes, it was sent(or in some cases *published*) with the thought that it could be useful to you. I really don't care if you use the resources I sent you or not. I felt sharing it with you was useful hence I did so.
- If there are errors, please report them.
- Discussions and follow up questions are always encouraged!!
- Feel free to [contact](./contact.html) me.
- If you don't want to receive any specific types of links or no links at all, please convey the information directly. I will promptly stop.
- Resources can be found on the internet. If not, [contact](./contact.html) me, I will **point** you in the correct direction.
