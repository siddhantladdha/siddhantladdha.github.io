- Programming and Computer Science are different even though the keywords are clubbed. You will find resources for Computer science here as well. 
- The heading can be argued about, but meh. People anyways read what piques their interest.
- Try to clear your doubts on the internet. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) recommended.
- Avoid Quora.

# My Programming Experience

- Elaborating this since I might be the wrong person for some types of advice.
- I did not study computer science beyond Network Level C Programming. I might not be the right person for taking advice regarding Computer Science.
- I did not write any production level software for Computers, hence I might not be the right person for taking advice regarding software development.
- I usually yank scripts from internet and seldom write scripts to get some boring work done.

# Beginner

- [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcabW7890RKJzL968QWEykA): The best course on Introductory Computer Programming. Learned C programming from this course. David Malan is a great teacher!! If you have no previous experience with computer programming start here!! Also, the CS50 TV and podcast is quite informative.
- [Data Structures Animation by Y. Daniel Liang](http://cs.armstrong.edu/liang/animation/animation.html): Does a good job of explaining basic data structures and basic algorithms using animations.
- Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart is the only reason I use python.
  - [Book available on Website in HTML format](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
  - It is also a great book for beginners since it assumes no previous programming experience.
- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/): Strongly recommend to see [Julia's Drawings](https://drawings.jvns.ca/)


# Post Beginner

- [DereK Banas Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas): If you know programming and want to learn language in one video this channel is for you. Awesome guy!!
- [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile): Learn from the masters of computer science.
- [CS50 Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381k8ul4WQ8SQ165XqY149WW): Everyone needs to revise once in a while.
- [Your languge sucks](https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/YourLanguageSucks) and perhaps not. Defend it [here](https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/Talk:YourLanguageSucks#).
- [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code): Contribute and Learn. I generally use it for optimized snippets to copy for quick scripts.
- [Comprehend this](https://web.archive.org/web/20200405060338/https://medium.com/better-programming/the-one-programming-language-to-rule-them-all-620366df2805)

## C 

- [C FAQ](http://c-faq.com/): Want to know the nitty-gritty details of C. Visit this site. Might answer some of your doubts too.
- The C Programming Language by Brian W Kernighan and Dennis M Ritchie: The Bible of C Programming.
- [Minimal C GUI Library](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear)
- [A Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)
- [A Guide to UNIX IPC](https://beej.us/guide/bgipc/)
- [Beej's Guide to C](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/)
- [C Programming Course Notes by University of Illinois, Chicago](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/C_Programming/index.html)
- [NCURSES Programming](https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/intro.html)
- [A rabbit hole of resources and articles](http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/)

## Python

- The language kills more than the snake.
- [You Can't Build an Iphone with Python](https://medium.com/s/story/you-cant-build-an-iphone-with-python-ad690e5b2164)
- My only problem with Python is that **It allows me to write poor quality code/program with very less effort**. Also, after about month I realized that I write poor quality code in C (it just takes 1 week instead of 15 mins). So I might be broken.
- People shit on other people for using Python, but here's the thing, great programmers write great programs in any language. Python might be a bottleneck to your program performance/benchmarks, but if it gets your work done ignore others. 
- Also, I am a hypocrite when it comes to python. I never took real efforts in understanding the language. I try reading Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart cover to cover but all efforts go in vain. 
- Currently I use Python only when required from the above reference.
- **P**ython is **O**bject **O**riented **P**oop (POOP) is an acronym that comes to mind, but I am in no position to say so.

## Perl

- I came 1 nm close to learning perl. I have seen/heard lots of awesome things about it, loved the community but here's the thing. 
Python was a default sane choice. I know I am following the herd mentality here, but programming is not my bread and butter so 
spending any more time analysing about my choices will not be judicious use of my time. If I *need* to learn perl, you will see the resources here.

## Machine Learning and Neural Networks.

- Don't rip me off. I am not going to create a different page for just this since **I did not pursue studying this any further.**

- Make your own Neural network by Tariq Rashid: An awesome book for beginners. By the end of the day, I had my own neural network made!! Do see his blog for supplementary material. 

- Andrew N. G.â€™s course on Machine learning: Helped me get a feel of what machine learning is all about.
