- Hi I am Siddhant. This website is primarily made for all the things that I want myself and other people to access from anywhere in the world with internet.

- The stuff I share here is what we would usually have a conversation over, except that I don't have to
repeat myself many times and anyone can strike a conversation with me!!

# How to use this site?

- Use the [Index](./index.html) to search for what you need.
- If I explicitly sent you a link to one of my pages/posts/notes, it was sent(or in some cases *published*) with the thought that it could be useful to you. See [link_sharing](./link_sharing.html).
- **Please make sure that before reading anything on this site the last-updated date is close to current date, so that the information posted is relevant/reliable at the time of reading.**
- If I feel that any post does not need to be updated anymore (for posts which share anecdotal evidence or commenting
on some event, random rants/ramblings etc.), I will **freeze** the post and its contents.
- Stay curious and try to read the posts on this page objectively. Analyze them critically. I may not find space in each and every article to start from the ‘scratch’. While writing I always assume that the reader(usually me) is curious enough to read between the lines. 
- Referring to the list of pre-requisites at the start of an article would maximize the benefits of reading articles.

# How can you help me?

- Please report any errors/misconceptions you find. I will update them after reviewing. 
- Also check out [bounty](./bounty.html) and see if you can help me out, in return for *monnneey*.

# Want to make something like this.

- First Advice: *Start!!*
- There will always be things to edit, more to add, errors to correct, but saying that *I will post it online when it is done perfectly will never make it happen.* The cost of perfection is infinite.
- Again the only advice I can give is *Start!!*

# Credits

- [Chinmay Pandhare](https://ccpandhare.github.io/GSoC-Guide/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and the open source community in general has helped me immensely in creating the functional form of this website.

*May the electrons, protons and neutrons be with you!!*
