# Notes

- No Youtube Video or Blog post is a replacement for professional advice.

## Android

- Android is a privacy nightmare[^nightmare]. If you are competent/willing/have time to tinker with Android without getting frustrated have a look at [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/) and [/e/ OS](https://e.foundation/)[^bounty].
- If above is not possible there are lots of guides on internet on how to disable privacy invading actions, the only hardwork required is in finding what works for you[^tinfoilhat].
- Try using apps from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) instead of from Play Store, you will actually have a better experience and many developers are helpful in bug fixes and feature requests.

[^nightmare]: Coming from a guy using Stock Android, other mods by OEM's are even worse.
[^bounty]: If you have successfully made Lineage OS or /e/ os Build for Nokia 6.1 2018, contact me for a bounty.
[^tinfoilhat]: Know your threat model and take steps accordingly.

## Alternatives

- [Switching Software: Ethical Alternatives](https://switching.software/)

### Secure Messaging Apps 

- [Website which offers comparison](https://www.securemessagingapps.com/)
- This is a great way to present comparisons on website. It took me a lot of reading to decide on Signal vs Riot since unlucky me did not know about this website then. This should not be the case with you.
It would have saved me hours of reading and confusion had I known about it. This will honestly make your decision process easier.

### PhotoScraping

- [This Person Does not Exists](thispersondoesnotexist.com) for services that are adamant about a Human profile picture.
