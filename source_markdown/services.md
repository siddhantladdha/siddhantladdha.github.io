# List of services

## Research Paper Notes

- This service is especially useful for students, who are interested in research in Electronics Engineering.
- When you want to be at par with the state of the art Industry standards and innovation, it involves reading lots of research papers, articles from reputed journals, application notes, conference proceedings, white papers et cetera. However, reading such information dense resources which were written for people who are already experts in their respective fields; takes a toll on student readers.
- I don't say that these resources are bad for you. If anything they are the **most** reliable source of information you will ever read on a particular topic.
- However, they are information dense, and to people like me they seem daunting at first sight. However, once you understand how to read those *first set of papers* the further readings seem less and less daunting.
- This is where my service comes into play. I want to share the experience with you first hand, and carefully guide you through the process. Simplify things for you, so that it seems less daunting.
- Due to the highly specialised nature of this service, it is applicable for the following fields only.
  - Analog/Digital/Mixed-Signal VLSI/Discrete circuit design.
  - RF and Microwave Circuits.
- If you have papers in any other fields feel free to contact me so that I may guide you to resource/person who can help you with your task.

All of us have been in such a situation before. And many times we might not have people around us who
could explain it the way we want. So if you are a curious one and want to learn and understand the 
complicated stuff explained in simple and easy to follow steps, you are in the right place.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Following is the list of questions that I get frequently asked in E-mail. I am Posting them here so that you don't 
have to ask them again!!

- **Why are your charges for Research Paper notes so high?**
  - Yes they are quite high for one student. However, whenever I am approached by students for this service,
   it is usually that they are assigned to read the paper for about half-semester. And it is the same paper 
   for every student taking that particular course. I suggest that they share the expenses within the group. 
   And they are happy to do so, which brings it to manageable level. **Remember I am a student too** However, 
   providing this service takes a **huge amount of time** but I still enjoy providing this service since 
   I get to learn new things!!

- **You beat drums for open source projects, yet you hypocritically ask for payment for your services?**
  - Yes, that was a **real question** asked to me more than I expect and desire, although in different language 
   (If you know Hindi you know the exact statement!). Well frankly speaking I spend time and my cognitive energy working 
   on providing you the best of the services. See I spend time and energy here. Most of the services that world has to offer 
   are paid services as well!! Once it is paid for monetarily (no exposure, no shout-out, just *plain hard cash* speaking
   figuratively), I feel that it is ready to be open sourced. Because "initial investment" of time and energy has 
   been paid for. The content is then released into Public Domain or open-sourced under some other license.
